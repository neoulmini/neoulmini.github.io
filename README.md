# Neoulmini — Universal Mini-Language

**Neoulmini** is a minimalist universal language created by *I. Beklemishchev-Petrov* in 2025. Designed for interspecies and intertemporal communication, it uses just **12 core symbols** to express essential concepts that can be understood by any intelligent entity — including animals, AI, and potentially extraterrestrials.

## 🌐 What is Neoulmini?

Neoulmini is based on principles of **semiotics**, **cognitive psychology**, and **physical constants**. Its simplicity makes it suitable for communication across vastly different forms of perception and intelligence.

## 🔣 The 12 Symbols

| Symbol | Concept       | Description                    |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| ●      | Object        | Any material item              |
| →      | Action        | Movement, influence            |
| ↑      | Increase      | Growth, amplification          |
| ↓      | Decrease      | Reduction, weakening           |
| ⊙      | Energy        | Light, heat, force             |
| ‖      | Barrier       | Obstacle, separation           |
| □      | Container     | Space, vessel                  |
| !      | Danger        | Threat, warning                |
| ?      | Question      | Unknown, inquiry               |
| §      | Connection    | Relation, bond                 |
| ∞      | Eternity      | Time, cycles                   |
| ⁂      | System        | Complex structure              |

## 🧠 Grammar Rules

- **Linearity**: The order of symbols represents the sequence of events  
  → Example: `● → ●` = "Object acts on object"

- **Grouping**: Combine symbols to express more complex ideas  
  → Example: `□●` = "Object inside a container"

- **Levels of Interpretation**: From concrete (Level 1) to abstract (Level 4)

### 🕒 Tense/Aspect Extensions (Community-based)

Though not part of the original core grammar, users have proposed time-related symbol combinations:

| Symbol(s) | Meaning                  |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| →         | Present action (default) |
| →∞        | Future/cyclic action     |
| ↓→        | Decaying/progressive     |

**Examples:**

⊙ →∞ ●        - "Energy will act on object" (future)
● ↓→ □        - "Object slowly entering container" (decay)
!● → ↓        - "Dangerous object moves downward" (e.g., falling meteor)
□●§● → ∞      - "Connected objects exist eternally" (e.g., ecosystem)
⊙ → ● → ● → ●□§? → ‖●●● → ↑● → ● → ● → ∞  - Description of the solar system and invitation to contact

## 🚀 Potential Applications

- Interstellar communication (like a modern Arecibo message)
- Post-apocalyptic knowledge preservation
- Human-AI mediation
- Cognitive experiments with animals and artificial agents
